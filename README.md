## Hey, I’m Thiago 👋

Full stack, front-end leaning. I build web and mobile products that ship, scale, and stay maintainable.

- Primary: TypeScript, React
- Also: React Native (Expo), Node.js
- Interests: performance, UI architecture, DX, accessibility (a11y)

### Tech stack
**Frontend**

- Next.js, PWAs
- UI: MUI, Ant Design, Tailwind, Sass
- i18n: i18next
- Accessibility (a11y), UX-focused implementation

**Backend**

**Cloud and tooling**

### What I like working on
- UI architecture for large apps (tables, scheduling, complex state)
- Performance tuning and render profiling
- Reliable workflows, testing strategy, good DX
- Cross-platform patterns (web + mobile)

### Projects
